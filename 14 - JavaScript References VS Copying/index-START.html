    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    const newPlayers = players.slice();
    const newPlayers2 = [].concat(players);
    const newPlayers3 = [...players];
    const newPlayers4 = Array.from(players);

    newPlayers4[0] = 'Max';
    console.log(players, newPlayers4);
    // console.log(newPlayers);

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    const person = {
      name: 'Mary',
      age: 28,
      socials: {
        twitter: '@hi',
        facebook: 'hello.me'
      }
    };


    // const pers2 = person;
    // const pers2 = Object.assign({},person,{name: 'Jan'});

    const pers2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(person));

    // pers2.name = 'Jan';

    console.log( person, pers2 );


    // with Objects

    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
